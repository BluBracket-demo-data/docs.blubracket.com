Preventing risks in code # As developers, we depend on a quick feedback loop to understand if our code is working and does what is expected. BluBracket tools can offer automated security guidance as part of that feedback loop, in the IDE of your choice, pre-commit, and as part of the CI flow.</description></item><item><title>Integrations</title><link>https://docs.blubracket.com/intro/integrations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.blubracket.com/intro/integrations/</guid><description> Local/workstation tools CLI Code servers GitHub GitLab Bitbucket Azure DevOps (contact us for beta) Gerrit (coming soon) CI servers GitHub Checks Bitbucket Code Insights Jenkins and more via open API Identity, authentication, and authorization Azure AD Okta Ping SAML OAuth (coming soon) Messaging Slack Microsoft Teams Ticketing &amp;amp; incident management Jira ServiceNow PagerDuty Splunk Build your own APIs Webhooks (coming soon)</description></item></channel></rss>
