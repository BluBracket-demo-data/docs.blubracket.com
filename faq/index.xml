BluBracket can identify hundreds of different types of secrets in code, including tokens, keys, IDs and passwords, but the BluBracket CLI tool also supports user-defined regular expressions to match and alert on.
For more detailed information on how to add regular expressions to the CLI, look here.</description></item><item><title>Can I find secrets before they are committed?</title><link>https://docs.blubracket.com/faq/can-i-find-secrets-before-committed/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.blubracket.com/faq/can-i-find-secrets-before-committed/</guid><description>Yes. With the BluBracket Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, you can catch secrets before the code is committed to a repository. Once downloaded and configured, the tool will report any risks found in commits and optionally block commits until they&amp;rsquo;re addressed.
The BluBracket CLI tool works with pre-commit hooks, and with any IDEs where the pre-commit hooks are supported.</description></item><item><title>Does BluBracket scan new commits to repositories?</title><link>https://docs.blubracket.com/faq/does-blubracket-scan-new-commits-to-repositories/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.blubracket.com/faq/does-blubracket-scan-new-commits-to-repositories/</guid><description>Yes. Each time a new commit is made to a monitored repository, BluBracket immediately scans the commit for any new risks. Any risks that are found will be displayed in the web dashboard, and alerted through any configured alert integrations.</description></item><item><title>Does BluBracket store/modify my code or any part of my code?</title><link>https://docs.blubracket.com/faq/does-blubracket-store-modify-my-code/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.blubracket.com/faq/does-blubracket-store-modify-my-code/</guid><description>No. BluBracket clones repositories, scans them, creates a hash of each of the files (for later comparisons), then the entire checkout from the BluBracket servers. All of this happens within a few seconds, depending on the repository size.
After the scan, BluBracket saves specific metadata to support alerting and reporting on any found risksâ€”things like repository names, file names, contributor IDs, commit IDs and times, etc.
BluBracket never stores any code after the scan.</description></item></channel></rss>
